# Please read the following first!
<p>Hello there. I've just recently come back to these accounts, and noticed I have gotten a couple inquiries about this repo specifically.</p>
<p>I'd like to first note that, this project was in progress and has since been lost, so I may or may not redo it entirely soon. If you have any questions or needs, <a href="mailto:nsfwhelp@proton.me">please reach out to me.</a> my discord does not work as of now, so I will try to fix it, so contact me from email for now.</p>

This will be a list of any possible to archive models from [smutba.se](https://smutba.se)\
We will attempt to make numerous backups so we can fully ensure the lifespan of models.
If you would like to contribute a model that isn't from smutba.se, please reach out to me below, or open an Issue below.

This list will be updated overtime as I work and as new models are uploaded, or new things I find.\
I hope this can help some people in any way.
