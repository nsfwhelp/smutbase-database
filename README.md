> [!WARNING]
> This tip is no longer accurate. I will fix this soon. <br/> ~~You can find specific models you like, as there are sorted tables for male, female, furry, global, etc.~~

This project may be a risk to host on GitHub, so I cannot fully show preview images how I intended, please click their Image Preview link to preview them ^^"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> <p>After testing for a moment, it looks like a markdown table can't fit all the data here ^^"</p> <p>I will try to find a solution, maybe such as hosting a GitHub pages.</p>

## Footer
<p>This will be a list of any possible to archive models from <a href="https://smutba.se">smutba.se</a></p>
<p>We will attempt to make numerous backups so we can fully ensure the lifespan of models.</p>
<p>If you would like to contribute a model that isn't from smutba.se, please reach out to me below, or open an Issue below.</p>

<p>This list will be updated overtime as I work and as new models are uploaded, or new things I find.</p>
<p>I hope this can help some people in any way.</p>
