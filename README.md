# Smutbase Database

![status](https://badgen.net/badge/Status/In%20Progress/yellow) [![view](https://hits.dwyl.com/nsfwhelp/smutbase-database.svg)](https://hits.dwyl.com/nsfwhelp/smutbase-database)

This is a list of all(?) models and users from [smutba.se](https://smutba.se)\
Done by a quick scraping tool I made\
**If you are for whatever reason interested in the code for the tool(its pretty basic), reach out to me here, or my email: <a href="mailto:nsfwhelp@proton.me">nsfwhelp@proton.me</a>**

This list will be updated overtime as I work and as new models are uploaded, or new things I find.\
I hope this can help some people in any way.

If you have anything to contribute or whatnot, create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/nsfwhelp/smutbase-database/pulls).\
If there is an issue create an [Issue](https://github.com/nsfwhelp/smutbase-database/issues).

*Side note: I may explore into creating a Wiki in this repo and see how it would work for sorting models etc.\
I need to figure something good enough out for sorting, so this repo may be changed a lot*
